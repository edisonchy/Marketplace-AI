# Carousell AI

Marketplace AI is an automation agent designed to interact with customers on an online marketplace. The goal of this project is to fully automate the sales process on the platform. The agent uses AI to identify customer intent and generate appropriate responses to meet their needs. It tracks payments through email forwarding and webhooks (via FastAPI), and once payment is confirmed, it automatically handles the delivery of the purchased product.

## Features

- Handles response types: BUY, ASK, PAID, OTHER
- Implements safeguards to reduce AI hallucinations
- Generates tailored, AI-driven responses to customer inquiries
- Supports multiple languages with automatic language detection
- Monitors payments via webhook integration and email parsing
